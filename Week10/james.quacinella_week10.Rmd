# Exercise 7.6.1 (section 7.6.7)

Exercise 7.6.1 : Execute the BDMO Algorithm with p = 3 on the following 1-dimensional, Euclidean data:

1, 45, 80, 24, 56, 71, 17, 40, 66, 32, 48, 96, 9, 41, 75, 11, 58, 93, 28, 39, 77

The clustering algorithms is k-means with k = 3. Only the centroid of a cluster, along with its count, is needed to represent a cluster.

## Answer

```{r}
points <- c(1, 45, 80, 24, 56, 71, 17, 40, 66, 32, 48, 96, 9, 41, 75, 11, 58, 93, 28, 39, 77)
```
