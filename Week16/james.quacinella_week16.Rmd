# Exercise 11.4.1

The SVD for the matrix is given. Find the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of M .

```{r}
M <- matrix(c(48, 14, 14, -48), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)

U <- matrix(c(3/5, 4/5, 4/5, -3/5), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
Sigma <- matrix(c(50, 0, 0, 25), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
Vt <- matrix(c(4/5, -3/5, 3/5, 4/5), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)

U %*% Sigma %*% Vt
```

How is this a SVD decomposition of M??

```{r}
library(MASS)
ginv(M)
```

# Exercise 11.3.4

Section 11.3.5 showed how to guess the movies a person would most like. How would you use a similar technique to guess the people that would most like a given movie, if all you had were the ratings of that movie by a few people?
